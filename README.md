# Introduction
Have you ever faced problems while furniture shopping online? Faced the pain of manually designing and measuring your furniture placing ideas?  What about the inconvenience of liking a product online just to find out they won't fit or are too small? We present to you *FurnitAR*, your one-stop solution to solve all your problems and hassles related to online furniture shopping!

# About FurintAR
Using *FurnitAR* users would be able to measure real-world objects or even space by simply pointing their phone’s camera at the given item using Augmented Reality(AR) technology. 
The measurements which are taken using AR will be used to display the relevant options of furniture which can be purchased from various E-commerce websites.
In addition, users can also place a 3d model of their furniture in their room to get experience in real time.
Our application can also be used to get readings in metric units to bring back up when you’re at IKEA.
